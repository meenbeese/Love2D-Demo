# Love2D Demo

This is a Love2D simulation where a ball bounces inside a spinning hexagon. The ball is affected by gravity and friction, and it interacts realistically with the rotating walls.

## Demo

## Features
- Physics-based ball movement with gravity and friction.
- A hexagon that rotates at a constant speed.
- Realistic collision handling with moving walls.
- Implemented using Love2D and Lua.

## Requirements
- [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) (0.10+ recommended)

## Installation and Running
1. Install Love2D from [love2d.org](https://love2d.org/).
2. Clone or download this repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/meenbeese/Love2D-Demo.git
   cd Love2D-Demo
   ```
3. Run the project using Love2D:
   ```sh
   love .
   ```

## Controls
- **Escape** - Exit the program

## Customization
You can modify parameters like gravity, friction, and hexagon rotation speed in `main.lua`.
